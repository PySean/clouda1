%TODO: Need graphs in preferably pdf format

\section{Work Division}
Lee handled the server setup. Corey devised the mapping and reducing algorithms, and Lee
translated these algorithms to their Python form. Sean fixed issues with server setup,
and also worked with Lee on finding optimisation parameters for both parts of the
assignment. He also wrote Perl scripts to ease the formation of relevant MapReduce
command lines.

\section{Performance Explanation}

We did stuff and everything is really nice!
